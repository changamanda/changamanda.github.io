For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved using computers to create art. In college, I majored in Theater Studies at Yale University, focusing particularly on how theater-makers can use projections and technology to develop innovative works.

After graduation, I spent a year freelancing as a theatrical lighting designer, but I missed the sense of empowerment I always received from programming in high school and college classes. I’m thrilled with my decision to return to coding, and grateful for the opportunity to take part in rewarding, relevant, and creative work.
